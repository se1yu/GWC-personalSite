    <h3> Here's a little about me!</h3>
    <p>
      I love cats. Love them! I spend my free time on weekends volunteering when I can. I also love plants and fish! I have a really niche obsession with <a href="https://www.nal.usda.gov/farms-and-agricultural-production-systems/hydroponics">Hydroponics.</a>
      My current favorite is Pothos with my Goldfish tank! 
      I also enjoy art, 3D modelling, music, programming, design, photography- and more!
